# This script shims the prettier interface and terraform fmt interface until
# terraform has native support.  Terraform fmt takes a directory as a single
# argument. This does not work because the Terraform files are spread out
# across multiple directories and we only want to format staged files.
#
# This script takes a list of files, copies them to a directory, terraform fmt
# that directory then copies them back to the original location.
