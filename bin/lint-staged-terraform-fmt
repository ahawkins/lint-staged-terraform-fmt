# This script shims the prettier interface and terraform fmt interface until
# terraform has native support. Terraform fmt takes a directory as a single
# argument. This does not work because the Terraform files are spread out
# across multiple directories and we only want to format staged files.
#
# This script takes a list of files, then pipes each to terraform fmt, then
# copies the original file.
